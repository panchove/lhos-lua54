    help
      Enable embedding the Lua 5.4 runtime into the application. This
      controls compilation of the Lua engine component and related
      bindings.

config LUA_USE_SPIRAM
    bool "Allocate Lua heap in SPIRAM when available"
    depends on LUA_ENABLED && SPIRAM
    default y
    help
      When set, the Lua runtime will prefer allocating its heap in
      external SPIRAM using MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM. The Lua allocator in
      the component should check this option and use pvPortMallocCaps
      appropriately.
